Basic Quiz -

I went down an HTML rabbit hole on this. Too much locked into HTML programming of the questions. I went down this path since there was only one group of questions. I realized the lack of flexibility, but, at that point, I chose to focus on the timer elements:
- Timer starts on page execution
- Timer counts down, at 3 seconds, text goes from green to red.
- If timer gets to zero, user is notified, submit button is disabled, score/commentary section becomes visible, and is compiled.
- If user clicks submit button, submit button is disabled, score/commentary becomes visible, and is compiled.
- Based upon the number of correct answers, "if" statements display commentary
- Score/commentary section holds a "Try again?" button with a reset function.
- Reset will re-enable submit button, clear radio button choices, hide score/commentary section, and reset timer.

I will submit a CSS-lite Advanced Assignment that utilizes jQuery and arrays to populate the question object
